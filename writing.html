              <p class="serif space-after-1-2">I have been thinking a lot lately about the things that make feel small and invisible. They are my kryptonite: make me feel small, insignificant and invisible, I shut down and run. Equally, I have been writing and jotting down all the things that don't make me feel insignificant.</p>
              <p class="serif space-after-1-2">I think about walking along a dirt road on a bright windy day, I think about being in the water, I think about hiking with friends. In all of these tiny scenarios, I am outside and there is this lightness in my being because finally, I can breathe. I can acknowledge that I am indeed, visible, significant and mighty. This brings me to the lovely quote by Warsan Shire.</p>
              <p class="serif space-after-1-2">This quote tells me that the moments where I am most in peace and in love with myself, happen more frequently than my anxious brain likes to admit. It also reminds me how easy it is to jump right back into an old photograph and feel those same feelings again. It reminds me how easy it is to feel that morning ocean breeze again and grin all over again</p>

            <div class="single-main-text">
              <p class="serif space-after-1-2">One of the best parts of going on a trip is the planning stage and I get an intense high and pleasure for packing. I went on a 10 day trip in November that involved a flight and two train trips. I managed to bring with me an umbrella, two winter coats, three cameras, a fluffy jumper, hiking/running gear, and a couple of souvenirs. Needless to say, I am proud of myself and quite smug about it, so here are three best tips.</p>
              <p class="sans-bold uppercase">One. Create a capsule wardrobe or a uniform and stick to it.</p>
              <p class="serif space-after-1-2">Think through at least 2 uniforms. For this trip in particular, my luggage consisted largely of casual outfit uniform pieces, a total of 15. Generally speaking, you want everything to go with everything.</p>
              <p class="sans-bold uppercase">TWO. Pack quality pieces.</p>
              <p class="serif space-after-1-2">Pack quality pieces because everything should have a double use. For example, have nice running leggings that you won't be ashamed to wear on your way to the airport. Having quality pieces that won't break down with frequent wear or washing is important.</p>
              <p class="sans-bold uppercase">Three. Fold your clothes the KonMari way.</p>
              <p class="serif space-after-1-2">I learned to fold my clothes into flattened shapes so they can be stacked vertically. According to Marie Kondo, this is wrong. The Marie Kondo way suggests rolling your clothes in a triangle shape that can stand upright on its own. This has been a game changer for me, rolling you clothes this way saves space and makes it easy to see every single item you're bringing with you. Bonus, if you do this at the end of each day, you keep things tidy and don't have to repack when its time to go home.</p>

        <p class="space-after2x time serif">11, June 2018</p>

        <div class="grid space-after2x">

          <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1">

            <div class="single-main-text">
              <p class="serif space-after-1-2">In these weird times we live in, I have been wrestling with the idea of that travelling is undoubtedly a luxury sport for the privileged. It's an uncomfortable truth for me, but it is unavoidable. Our planet has already been explored and conquered by so-called, <i>progress</i>. There is nothing left to be discovered.</p>
              <p class="serif space-after-1-2">There is a whole group of people who don't travel, they flee. They don't get to stay in $5,000 per day stays at the fanciest of hotels designed by the fanciest of architects. There are no selfies in front of the Trevi Fountain as they leisurely walk to find a local lunch spot. And so, I feel quite uncomfortable when confronted with perfectly colour-graded social media images of the trendiest, most <i>instagrammable</i> of locales. It's not wrong or wholly immoral, it just feels excessive and wasteful.</p>
              <p class="serif space-after-1-2">Every once in a while, I too get to exercise that privilege and set off into the world. To be fully transparent, my dream part-time job is travel the world over and take photographs (I say part-time because, there is a limit to everything, even the good things).</p>
              <p class="serif space-after-1-2 sentence">Years ago I came across the idea of slow travel from the books <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Idle-Traveller-Art-Slow-Travel/dp/0749574739" target="_blank">The Idle Traveller</a> by Dan Kieran and <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Fortune-Teller-Told-Me-Earthbound-Travels/dp/060980958X" target="_blank">A Fortune Teller Told Me</a> by Tiziano Terzani. Both of these books look at travel as a journey, that should be done more meaningfully and slowly. Dan Kieran, in particular, talks about how we rarely travel anywhere, a lot of us simply arrive. We trudge though identical looking airports, to watch the same familiar movies on our flights, hail a cab into our familiar hotels where they serve the same, familiar foods. We simply arrive instead of experiencing a journey, whereby we immerse our bodies and minds deep into a voyage.</p>
              <p class="serif">These types of prescriptions, the championing of slow travel for me feels more ethical, and quiet frankly, more unique. I try to base myself in one place and seek to become part of place, unimposing and almost invisible. I want to weave myself into that place. I want to have memories that are not repeatable and entirely mine. I want to have a relationship with that place and that time specifically. If other tourists ask me for directions or the customs officer assumes I am back home for a visit, then I have succeeded.</p>

Killing all that is old and useless, imbuing me with everything that makes one special to someone else. And new. The train keeps forward, further west, never catching up. The space between me, in that train, and that setting star, expanding. I am consumed by that space. In a few short hours, I am with friends, tasting and drinking like it was the first time. I've always wanted to like Toronto and today, I am indifferent, pining for that setting star instead. Languishing at the space between it and I.</p>

              <p class="serif space-after-1-2">During the summer of my sixteenth birthday, I spent my two-and-a-half month summer holiday in Paris and yet, I don't have any lasting memories of those months. I can only remember celebrating my birthday with a dinner at home and feeling so special. I can't remember feeling exceptionally happy otherwise, so much of the day-to-day was safe, predictable, and not where I wanted to be. I didn't know where I wanted to be.</p>
              <p class="sans-bold uppercase">Two. Water.</p>
              <p class="serif space-after-1-2">On a cloudy, late August, driving back to our small house from the airport my heart was racing. Someone we knew had passed away. Breathing heavily, I looked around my room where nothing had changed since I left but everything had changed.</p>
              <p class="sans-bold uppercase">Three. Kids.</p>
              <p class="serif space-after-1-2">Less than two weeks later, we were all back at school, excited by the stories of Paris I could share and a new boy. He too has passed now. I often think I'll run into him as I turn a corner, just like we did in school between classes. Those tiny moments thrilled me to no end.</p>
              <p class="sans-bold uppercase">Four. Trees.</p>
              <p class="serif space-after-1-2">This was also the first year I took my very first philosophy class. We started our first lesson debating the, “If a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound?" I didn't know how transformative philosophy could be. It was only the beginning yet everything had changed.</p>

            <p class="serif space-after2x">The next day starts early with a boat ride to the island of If. I tell myself that a different kind of sun lives here. Suddenly, we are back on the water, picking up speed and the cold wind. I study the passengers in front of me, young olive-skinned boys off work, joking and lighting cigarettes when one of them sitting behind me starts up a conversation. I am intrigued. It is evening now on the water. We find a calm English pub but I am too excited to sit down, I want to move my body. Over beers and talks about family and home, he holds my hand softly on his lap while his stubble tickles my cheek. Trembling, I count the hours before the return up north. Twenty-four.</p>
            <p class="sans-bold uppercase">To stay:</p>
            <p class="sans-reg space-after-1-2">Stay inhe neighbourhood of La Villette, if you want to be close to the city centre. To be near the beaches and hiking trails, try the 9e and 10e arrondissement, which are closer to the Parc national des Calanques.</p>
            <p class="sans-bold uppercase">To see:</p>
            <p class="sans-reg">Notre Dame-de-la-Grade and La Cité Radieuse (both free admissions), they offer the most stunning views of the city. I would suggest lingering there, bring some lunch and a book to read, sit on the ground, feel the sea breeze, let the sun kiss your cheeks.</p>

              <p class="serif space-after-1-2">Kinshasa doesn't make it to anyone's top travel destinations. For myself, it's a place I've always thought about, heard spoken about, and wanted to experience. It's an immense privilege to have been to a place with so much history, life, and where the homogenizing effects of the West are slow to come and slow to stick.</p>
              <p class="serif space-after-1-2"> I went to Kinshasa by myself first in 2011 and again with my papa in 2014. Both of these trips were planned so that I could meet again my father's side of the family, mainly my grandmother Caroline; but, what I remember most about these trips are my father, mainly his jedi-like disposition. I also felt my own lack in confidence more profoundly, too timid to ask for space from my little cousins, whose awareness of my every move and doting was too much, too intense. On a phone call, I remember lamenting to him how odd all of this attention felt, he simply laughed and very reasonably told me to relax, “They're just happy to be with you.”</p>
              <p class="serif">So much has changed, the Kinshasa that I know is remarkably different from the one that he grew up in. To me, it's exciting and wholly frustrating. I just want it to be more. To live up to its potential.</p>
