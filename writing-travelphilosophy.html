              <p class="sans-light space-after-1-2">Traveling for pleasure is undoubtedly a luxury sport for all us privileged enough to do it. Whilst, I don't have the account balance that affords me trips every year, I actively dream and spend my free time planning for upcoming trips I can only dream will come true.</p>
              <p class="sans-light space-after-1-2">In these weird times we live in, I have been wrestling with the idea of traveling and why I seek it so desperately. Both my parents moved from their respective countries looking for better days. They met in this new middle ground where my brother and I were born. Yet this middle ground wasn’t enough and so, we moved, staying a year here and there before settling in a country that was new to all four of us.</p>
              <p class="sans-light space-after-1-2">There is a whole group of people who don't travel per se, they flee. And there is a whole group of people who don't have the proper governmental infrastructure that supports travel. And so, I feel quite uncomfortable when confronted with perfectly colour-graded social media images of bouncy bodies on the trendiest, most <i>Instagrammable</i> of beaches. It's not wrong, it just feels excessive and wasteful.</p>
              <p class="sans-light space-after-1-2">Every once in a while, I too exercise that privilege and set off into the world. To be fully transparent, my dream part-time job is travel the world over and take photographs. I say part-time because, there is a limit to everything.</p>
              <p class="sans-light space-after-1-2 sentence">Years ago I came across the idea of slow travel from the books <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Idle-Traveller-Art-Slow-Travel/dp/0749574739" target="_blank">The Idle Traveller</a> by Dan Kieran and <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Fortune-Teller-Told-Me-Earthbound-Travels/dp/060980958X" target="_blank">A Fortune Teller Told Me</a> by Tiziano Terzani. Both of these books look at travel as a journey, that should be done more meaningfully and slowly. Dan Kieran, in particular, talks about how we rarely travel anywhere, a lot of us simply arrive. We trudge though identical looking airports, to watch the same familiar movies on our flights, hail a cab into our familiar hotels where they serve the same, familiar types foods. We simply arrive instead of experiencing a journey, whereby we take our bodies and minds deep into one place to another.</p>
              <p class="sans-light space-after-1-2">This is what travel has always been for me, thanks in part to these two wonderful books. I always say, I just want to see the world. And so, I rarely make plans, hotels are always the last resort, I walk everywhere, avoid taxis, take trains, ferries and buses, buy groceries, get lost, wander, stay in the small villages, travel during the off-season (I am not a fan of that term, every place is worth a visit anytime of year), visit local markets and eat at the small, hidden places. My one goal however, is to always interact genuinely and meaningfully with locals and taking my time to meet people, chat them up, wish them a good day, and offer a compliment. To be present and still.</p>
              <p class="sans-light space-after-1-2">Slow travel for me feels more ethical, I try to base myself in one place and seek to become part of place but also unimposing, almost invisible. If other tourists ask me for directions or the customs officer assumes I am back home for a visit, then I have succeeded.</p>
