              <p class="space-after2x">Straight ahead, before me, I am staring into the red sky. I am moving, yet seated and motionless, the train doing all of the work for me. I feel relieved to be leaving and hopeful. Staring into the messy red sun, I hope it will envelope me whole. Killing all that is old and useless, imbuing me with everything that makes one special to someone else. And new. The train keeps forward, further west, never catching up. The space between me, in that train, and that setting star, expanding. I am consumed by that space. In a few short hours, I am with friends, tasting and drinking like it was the first time. I've always wanted to like Toronto and today, I am indifferent, pining for that setting star instead. Languishing at the space between it and I.</p>
              <p class="sans-bold uppercase">Notable places to eat, to drink:</p>

              <p class="sans-bold uppercase">One. Paris.</p>
              <p class="space-after-1-2">During the summer of my sixteenth birthday, I spent my two-and-a-half month summer holiday in Paris and yet, I don't have any lasting memories of those months. I can only remember celebrating my birthday with a dinner at home and feeling so special. I can't remember feeling exceptionally happy otherwise, so much of the day-to-day was safe, predictable, and not where I wanted to be. I didn't know where I wanted to be.</p>
              <p class="sans-bold uppercase">Two. Water.</p>
              <p class="space-after-1-2">On a cloudy, late August, driving back to our small house from the airport my heart was racing. Someone we knew had passed away. Breathing heavily, I looked around my room where nothing had changed since I left yet indeed, everything had changed.</p>
              <p class="sans-bold uppercase">Three. Kids.</p>
              <p class="space-after-1-2">Less than two weeks later, we were all back at school, excited by the stories of Paris I could share and a new boy. He too has passed now. I often think I'll run into him as I turn a corner, just like we did in school between classes. Those tiny moments thrilled me to no end.</p>
              <p class="sans-bold uppercase">Four. Trees.</p>
              <p>This was also the first year I took my very first philosophy class. We started our first lesson debating the, “If a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound?" I didn't know how transformative philosophy could be. It was only the beginning yet everything had changed.</p>

            <div class="single-main-text">
            <p class="space-after-1-2">With every turn we are getting higher and my fear of heights kicks in. I forget all of this sitting on steps at the top of Marseille where the sun kisss my skin whilst the wind caresses my face. I am swimming in bliss.</p>
            <p class="space-after2x">The next day starts early with a boat ride to the island of If. I tell myself that a different kind of sun lives here. Suddenly, we are back on the water, picking up speed and the cold wind. I study the passengers in front of me, young olive-skinned boys off work, joking and lighting cigarettes when one of them sitting behind me starts up a conversation. I am intrigued. It is evening now on the water. We find a calm English pub but I am too excited to sit down, I want to move my body. Over beers and talks about family and home, he holds my hand softly on his lap while his stubble tickles my cheek. Trembling, I count the hours before the return up north. Twenty-four.</p>
            <p class="sans-bold uppercase">To stay:</p>
            <p class="space-after-1-2">Stay in the neighbourhood of La Villette if you want to be close to the city centre. To be near the beaches and hiking trails, try the 9e and 10e arrondissement, which are closer to the Parc national des Calanques.</p>
            <p class="sans-bold uppercase">To see:</p>
            <p>Notre Dame-de-la-Grade and La Cité Radieuse (both free admissions), they offer the most stunning views of the city. I would suggest lingering there, bring some lunch and a book to read, sit on the ground, feel the sea breeze, let the sun kiss your cheeks.</p>
