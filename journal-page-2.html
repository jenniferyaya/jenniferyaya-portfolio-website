              <p class="serif space-after-1-2">In these weird times we live in, I have been wrestling with the idea of that travelling is undoubtedly a luxury sport for the privileged. It's an uncomfortable truth for me, but it is unavoidable. Our planet has already been explored and conquered by so-called, <i>progress</i>. There is nothing left to be discovered.</p>
              <p class="serif space-after-1-2">There is a whole group of people who don't travel, they flee. They don't get to stay in $5,000 per day stays at the fanciest of hotels designed by the fanciest of architects. There are no selfies in front of the Trevi Fountain as they leisurely walk to find a local lunch spot. And so, I feel quite uncomfortable when confronted with perfectly colour-graded social media images of the trendiest, most <i>instagrammable</i> of locales. It's not wrong or wholly immoral, it just feels excessive and wasteful.</p>
              <p class="serif space-after-1-2">Every once in a while, I too get to exercise that privilege and set off into the world. To be fully transparent, my dream part-time job is travel the world over and take photographs (I say part-time because, there is a limit to everything, even the good things).</p>
              <p class="serif space-after-1-2 sentence">Years ago I came across the idea of slow travel from the books <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Idle-Traveller-Art-Slow-Travel/dp/0749574739" target="_blank">The Idle Traveller</a> by Dan Kieran and <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Fortune-Teller-Told-Me-Earthbound-Travels/dp/060980958X" target="_blank">A Fortune Teller Told Me</a> by Tiziano Terzani. Both of these books look at travel as a journey, that should be done more meaningfully and slowly. Dan Kieran, in particular, talks about how we rarely travel anywhere, a lot of us simply arrive. We trudge though identical looking airports, to watch the same familiar movies on our flights, hail a cab into our familiar hotels where they serve the same, familiar foods. We simply arrive instead of experiencing a journey, whereby we immerse our bodies and minds deep into a voyage.</p>
              <p class="serif">These types of prescriptions, the championing of slow travel for me feels more ethical, and quite frankly, more unique. I try to base myself in one place and seek to become part of place, unimposing and almost invisible. I want to weave myself into that place. I want to have memories that are not repeatable and entirely mine. I want to have a relationship with that place and that time specifically. If other tourists ask me for directions or the customs officer assumes I am back home for a visit, then I have succeeded.</p>

            <div class="single-main-text">
              <p class="serif space-after-1-2">One of the best parts of going on a trip is the planning stage and I get an intense high and pleasure for packing. I went on a 10 day trip in November that involved a flight and two train trips. I managed to bring with me an umbrella, two winter coats, three cameras, a fluffy jumper, hiking/running gear, and a couple of souvenirs. Needless to say, I am proud of myself and quite smug about it, so here are three best tips.</p>
              <p class="sans-bold uppercase">One. Create a capsule wardrobe or a uniform and stick to it.</p>
              <p class="serif space-after-1-2">Think through at least 2 uniforms. For this trip in particular, my luggage consisted largely of casual outfit uniform pieces, a total 15. Generally speaking, you want everything to go with everything.</p>
              <p class="sans-bold uppercase">TWO. Pack quality pieces.</p>
              <p class="serif space-after-1-2">Pack quality pieces because everything should have a double use. For example, have nice running leggings that you won't be ashamed to wear on your way to the airport. Having quality pieces that won't break down with frequent wear or washing is important.</p>
              <p class="sans-bold uppercase">Three. Fold your clothes the KonMari way.</p>
              <p class="serif space-after-1-2">I learned to fold my clothes into flattened shapes so they can be stacked vertically. According to Marie Kondo, this is wrong. The Marie Kondo way suggests rolling your clothes in a triangle shape that can stand upright on its own. This has been a game changer for me, rolling you clothes this way saves space and makes it easy to see every single item you're bringing with you. Bonus, if you do this at the end of each day, you keep things tidy and don't have to repack when its time to go home.</p>
