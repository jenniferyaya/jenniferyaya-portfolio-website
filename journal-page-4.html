        <p class="space-after2x time serif">14, February 2018</p>

            <p class="serif space-after-1-2">With every turn we are getting higher and my fear of heights kicks in. I forget all of this sitting on steps at the top of Marseille where the sun kisss my skin whilst the wind caresses my face. I am swimming in bliss.</p>
            <p class="serif space-after2x">The next day starts early with a boat ride to the island of If. I tell myself that a different kind of sun lives here. Suddenly, we are back on the water, picking up speed and the cold wind. I study the passengers in front of me, young olive-skinned boys off work, joking and lighting cigarettes when one of them sitting behind me starts up a conversation. I am intrigued. It is evening now on the water. We find a calm English pub but I am too excited to sit down, I want to move my body. Over beers and talks about family and home, he holds my hand softly on his lap while his stubble tickles my cheek. Trembling, I count the hours before the return up north. Twenty-four.</p>
            <p class="sans-bold uppercase">To stay:</p>
            <p class="sans-reg space-after-1-2">Stay in the neighbourhood of La Villette if you want to be close to the city centre. To be near the beaches and hiking trails, try the 9e and 10e arrondissement, which are closer to the Parc national des Calanques.</p>
            <p class="sans-bold uppercase">To see:</p>
            <p class="sans-reg">Notre Dame-de-la-Grade and La Cité Radieuse (both free admissions), they offer the most stunning views of the city. I would suggest lingering there, bring some lunch and a book to read, sit on the ground, feel the sea breeze, let the sun kiss your cheeks.</p>

              <p class="serif space-after-1-2">Kinshasa doesn't make it to anyone's top travel destinations. For myself, it's a place I've always thought about, heard spoken about, and wanted to experience. It's an immense privilege to have been to a place with so much history, life, and where the homogenizing effects of the West are slow to come and slow to stick.</p>
              <p class="serif space-after-1-2"> I went to Kinshasa by myself first in 2011 and again with my papa in 2014. Both of these trips were planned so that I could meet again my father's side of the family, mainly my grandmother Caroline; but, what I remember most about these trips are my father, mainly his jedi-like disposition. I also felt my own lack in confidence more profoundly, too timid to ask for space from my little cousins, whose awareness of my every move and doting was too much, too intense. On a phone call, I remember lamenting to him how odd all of this attention felt, he simply laughed and very reasonably told me to relax, “They're just happy to be with you.”</p>
              <p class="serif">So much has changed, the Kinshasa that I know is remarkably different from the one that he grew up in. To me, it's exciting and wholly frustrating. I just want it to be more. To live up to its potential.</p>
