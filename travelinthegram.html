              <p class="serif space-after-1-2">In these weird times we live in, I have been wrestling with the idea of that travelling is undoubtedly a luxury sport for the privileged. It's an uncomfortable truth for me, but it is unavoidable. Our planet has already been explored and conquered by so-called, <i>progress</i>. There is nothing left to be discovered.</p>
              <p class="serif space-after-1-2">There is a whole group of people who don't travel, they flee. They don't get to stay in $5,000 per day stays at the fanciest of hotels designed by the fanciest of architects. There are no selfies in front of the Trevi Fountain as they leisurely walk to find a local lunch spot. And so, I feel quite uncomfortable when confronted with perfectly colour-graded social media images of the trendiest, most <i>instagrammable</i> of locales. It's not wrong or wholly immoral, it just feels excessive and wasteful.</p>
              <p class="serif space-after-1-2">Every once in a while, I too get to exercise that privilege and set off into the world. To be fully transparent, my dream part-time job is travel the world over and take photographs (I say part-time because, there is a limit to everything, even the good things).</p>
              <p class="serif space-after-1-2 sentence">Years ago I came across the idea of slow travel from the books <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Idle-Traveller-Art-Slow-Travel/dp/0749574739" target="_blank">The Idle Traveller</a> by Dan Kieran and <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Fortune-Teller-Told-Me-Earthbound-Travels/dp/060980958X" target="_blank">A Fortune Teller Told Me</a> by Tiziano Terzani. Both of these books look at travel as a journey, that should be done more meaningfully and slowly. Dan Kieran, in particular, talks about how we rarely travel anywhere, a lot of us simply arrive. We trudge though identical looking airports, to watch the same familiar movies on our flights, hail a cab into our familiar hotels where they serve the same, familiar foods. We simply arrive instead of experiencing a journey, whereby we immerse our bodies and minds deep into a voyage.</p>
              <p class="serif">These types of prescriptions, the championing of slow travel for me feels more ethical, and quite frankly, more unique. I try to base myself in one place and seek to become part of place, unimposing and almost invisible. I want to weave myself into that place. I want to have memories that are not repeatable and entirely mine. I want to have a relationship with that place and that time specifically. If other tourists ask me for directions or the customs officer assumes I am back home for a visit, then I have succeeded.</p>
