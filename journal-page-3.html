              <p class="serif space-after2x">Straight ahead, before me, I am staring into the red sky. I am moving, yet seated and motionless, the train doing all of the work for me. I feel relieved to be leaving and hopeful. Staring into the messy red sun, I hope it will envelope me whole. Killing all that is old and useless, imbuing me with everything that makes one special to someone else. And new. The train keeps forward, further west, never catching up. The space between me, in that train, and that setting star, expanding. I am consumed by that space. In a few short hours, I am with friends, tasting and drinking like it was the first time. I've always wanted to like Toronto and today, I am indifferent, pining for that setting star instead. Languishing at the space between it and I.</p>

              <p class="serif space-after-1-2">During the summer of my sixteenth birthday, I spent my two-and-a-half month summer holiday in Paris and yet, I don't have any lasting memories of those months. I can only remember celebrating my birthday with a dinner at home and feeling so special. I can't remember feeling exceptionally happy otherwise, so much of the day-to-day was safe, predictable, and not where I wanted to be. I didn't know where I wanted to be.</p>
              <p class="sans-bold uppercase">Two. Water.</p>
              <p class="serif space-after-1-2">On a cloudy, late August, driving back to our small house from the airport my heart was racing. Someone we knew had passed away. Breathing heavily, I looked around my room where nothing had changed since I left yet indeed, everything had changed.</p>
              <p class="sans-bold uppercase">Three. Kids.</p>
              <p class="serif space-after-1-2">Less than two weeks later, we were all back at school, excited by the stories of Paris I could share and a new boy. He too has passed now. I often think I'll run into him as I turn a corner, just like we did in school between classes. Those tiny moments thrilled me to no end.</p>
              <p class="sans-bold uppercase">Four. Trees.</p>
              <p class="serif">This was also the first year I took my very first philosophy class. We started our first lesson debating the, “If a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound?" I didn't know how transformative philosophy could be. It was only the beginning yet everything had changed.</p>
