              <p class="space-after-1-2">Kinshasa doesn't make it to anyone's top travel destinations. For myself, it's a place I've always thought about, heard spoken about, and wanted to experience. It's an immense privilege to have been to a place with so much history, life, and where the homogenizing effects of the West are slow to come and slow to stick.</p>
              <p class="space-after-1-2"> I went to Kinshasa by myself first in 2011 and again with my papa in 2014. Both of these trips were planned so that I could meet again my father's side of the family, mainly my grandmother Caroline; but, what I remember most about these trips are my father, mainly his jedi-like disposition. I also felt my own lack in confidence more profoundly, too timid to ask for space from my little cousins, whose awareness of my every move and doting was too much, too intense. On a phone call, I remember lamenting to him how odd all of this attention felt, he simply laughed and very reasonably told me to relax, “They're just happy to be with you.”</p>
              <p>So much has changed, the Kinshasa that I know is remarkably different from the one that he grew up in. To me, it's exciting and wholly frustrating. I just want it to be more. To live up to its potential.</p>
